    <img src="image/single-book.jpg" alt="book">
   <p> Founded in 1993, Books n' Beans had its humble beginnings as a resale store for outdated college textbooks. As its cult status in the community grew, so did customer demand for a reliable source of caffeine. Thus, the current iteration of Books n' Beans was born.<br>We're open 7 days a week, offering impeccable coffee, fine pastries, and the most esoteric of publications. Stop in for a hot beverage—stick around for lost French translations of Howard Zinn!<br>Sincerely,<br>
Your Friends at Books n' Beans
<br>123 Main Street, Northampton, MA 01060 | Phone: 413.555.5555
Open Monday - Saturday from 7am to 10pm | Sunday from 8am to 6pm</p>
